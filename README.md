# Bio-bottle
## Observations
| Time of Observations | Observation |
| -- | -- | 
| Day 0 Pre-sealing | Duck weed on water with very high turbidity due to dirt |
| Day 0 Post-sealing | The exact same expect it is a little more shaken |
| Day 2 | Much lower turbidity but still cant see all the way through the bottle. Duck weed has "jumped" to the sloped part of the bottle and idk how it got there. Root looking things are at the bottom with no clear plant, might be the moss. The slug that came with the duck weed is not visible and the other macro invertebrates added earlier are also not visible|
